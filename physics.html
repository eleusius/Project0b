                    The basic principle of this idea is that, rather than the universe expanding asymmetrically from the big bang in a “forward” time direction, with “matter” asymmetrically created and “anti-matter” somehow absent from our universe; instead the universe expanded symmetrically in (at least) a “forward” and “backward” time direction, and potentially in a “neutral” or “static” time direction as well.  In this way a universe of “matter,” with which we are familiar, as well as a universe of “anti-matter,” i.e. matter moving in an “anti-time” direction, and a universe of “super-symmetric matter” or something of the sort simultaneously evolved from the big bang in opposite or orthogonal directions.  What physics calls “dark matter” is potentially the “reflection” of our material universe existing in a “parallel” universe connected to ours through the big bang singularity.  And likewise “dark energy” represents the universe expanding in a “neutral time” direction.

                <p class="text1">
                    Since our universe technically consists of 3.5 dimensions (three spatial and one-half time dimension), and the “opposite” universe would be the same, for a total of 7 dimensions, I guess that the “orthogonal” universe would consist of 4 dimensions, for a total of 11, which would match with M-theory’s theoretical minimum number of dimensions required for string theory to be consistent.
                </p>
                <p class="text1">
                    Additionally, imagine a change in our universe in the “present moment” as a vibration in a one-dimensional circle representing the three spatial dimensions of our universe compactified for simplicity.  This vibration would travel along a two-dimensional world-sheet, let’s imagine “backwards” toward the origin, and then “forward” in “anti-time” toward the “present moment” of the “anti-time universe,” causing a corresponding vibration in that plane.  Because the “time” and “anti-time” distances would be nearly identical, it would cause a nearly simultaneous change in the “anti-time universe,” analogous to what is observed when one of two entangled particles is measured and a simultaneous change is detected in the other.
