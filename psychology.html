                    This part of the idea is based on Carl G. Jung’s theory of the unconscious mind - specifically that in addition to the conscious layer of the psyche, each of us has both an individual and a collective layer of unconscious mind, which comes forth symbolically, e.g. in dreams, free association, or the creative process.
                 </p>
                 <p class="text1">
                    Our conscious mind would be represented by the “material” or “normal time” layer of the universe.  While our unconscious mind would be represented by the “backwards time” or “dark matter” layer of the universe.  Just as in physics it is surmised that, for example, each galaxy is supported by a much larger “halo” of dark matter, which serves as the gravitational base which helps form galaxies and such; likewise our conscious mind is the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, of our unconscious mental processes, which support our limited conscious experience.
                 </p>
                 <p class="text1">
                    Further, as in physics “dark energy” drives the very expansion of the universe and is by far the greatest energetic component of the universe; so too does the “collective unconscious” underlie and bind together by means of “archetypes” of shared experience our individual mental experiences.  In this way, for example, culture seems to evolve in a way such that, though individuals seem to be contributing individual processes to our collective evolutionary process, it is rather that the culture itself is evolving and individuals are merely representatives.  Someone like Richard Dawkins would say that the “memes” or the “genes” themselves are driving the process through random generation and natural selection.  However, Jung would likely counter that the “memes” themselves are individual expressions of collective archetypes seeking expression in the world.
