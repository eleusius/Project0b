                    I was raised Catholic, with the idea of a Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  I became interested in Eastern Religions in high school, with their three-fold division of the world into body, mind and spirit / speech.  Trying to unite these concepts with science has been a life-long journey, and I am not sure I haven’t just tried too hard to put things together which were never meant to be so.  But basically the idea is that there is a fundamental duality - God and Human, or Body and Mind, or Samsara and Nirvana - and then there is the non-duality which is beyond extremes which is the third element.  And then there is the Tao which cannot be named, the “eternal Tao” or that which is beyond all possibility of conceptualization, which can only be experienced.  This is beyond even the duality of “duality and non-duality.”  The “+1” which extends the Holy Trinity.  The “one of these things is not like the others.”

                 <p class="text1">
                    So in this conception of the universe, the Singularity which is the origin (and probably eventual end) of time and space is also represented by the spiralling arc connecting the three “zeros” in the diagram.  This is the “eternal Tao” - the flow or the Way which is the Source and Destination.  This is the “true face” of God.  Beyond existence and non-existence.
                 </p>
                 <p class="text1">
                    Again I will not try to explain everything because there are obviously individual differences between the various religions and how they view the universe.  This is just an exercise in creating a website, not a dissertation.  And I don’t know anything, really, except that this idea won’t leave me alone.  It’s my ideosyncratic, crazy attempt to make some sense out of a crazy world.  And it hasn’t necessarily served me well, so why would I bother to try to convince anyone else of its merit?
